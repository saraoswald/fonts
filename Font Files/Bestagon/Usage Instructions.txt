    - Hearts are mapped to their unicode equivalent, and can be accessed in InDesign from the Glyphs Panel. 
        - Here's a list of where all the special characters are mapped:
            - Open Heart: â™¡
            - Filled Heart: â™¥
            - Open Star: â˜†
            - Filled Star: â˜…
            - Long Wavy Dash: ã€°
            - Stress Mark: ðŸ’¢

Updates:
    (Dec 3, 2021)
    - Fixes the Â¿ in the Bold and Bold Italic weights so that they're not backwards. 
    - Adjusts some accents in the Thin weight to be closer to the character
    - Removes overlap inside glyphs for all weights, which may show up with certain image processors
